# Compiler Warning (level 4) CS8500

This takes the address of, gets the size of, or declares a pointer to a managed type ('type')

Even when used with the [unsafe](../language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) keyword, taking the address of a managed object, getting the size of a managed object, or declaring a pointer to a managed type is not allowed. A managed type is:  
  
- Any reference type  
- Any struct that contains a reference type as a field or property  
  
For more information, see [Unmanaged types](../language-reference/builtin-types/unmanaged-types.md).

The following sample generates CS8500:

```csharp
// CS8500.cs
// Compile with: /unsafe

class MyClass
{
    int a = 98;
}  

struct MyProblemStruct
{
    string s;
    float f;
}

struct MyGoodStruct
{
    int i;
    float f;
}

public class Program
{
    unsafe public static void Main()
    {
        // MyClass is a class, a managed type.
        MyClass s = new MyClass();
        MyClass* s2 = &s; // CS8500

        // The struct contains a string, a managed type.
        int i = sizeof(MyProblemStruct); // CS8500

        // The struct contains only value types.
        i = sizeof(MyGoodStruct); // OK
    }
}
```
